UBS agrees to buy Credit Sussie for over $2bln - 75% haircut from Friday’s Market Cap,"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crunch-time-credit-suisse-talks-033651935.html

UBS has agreed to buy Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse after increasing its offer to more than $2 billion, the Financial Times reported on Sunday, as authorities bid to stave off turmoil when the markets reopen.

Officials have been racing to rescue the 167-year-old bank, among the world's largest wealth managers, after a brutal week that saw the second- and third-largest U.S. bank failures in history. As one of 30 global banks seen as systemically important, any deal for Credit Suisse could ripple through global financial markets.

At least two major banks in Europe are examining scenarios of contagion possibly spreading in the region's banking sector and looking to the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank to step in with stronger signals of support, two senior executives with knowledge of the discussions told Reuters.

A person with knowledge of the talks earlier told Reuters that UBS sought $6 billion from the Swiss government as part of a possible purchase of its rival. The guarantees would cover the cost of winding down parts of Credit Suisse and potential litigation charges.

One source previously said the talks were encountering significant obstacles, and 10,000 jobs may have to be cut if the two banks combined. The Swiss Bank Employees Association on Sunday called for the immediate creation of a task force to deal with the risk to jobs.

Swiss broadcaster SRF and other media reported that the government would hold an ""important"" press conference later on Sunday. They did not give any more details.

But yeah, if governments have to guarantee all banks at all times to protect deposits, why whould you allow banks to make high risk moves and pay bonusses to shareholders and employees when they succeed, only to have taxpayers make up the difference when it all fails.

Ok technically Credit Suisse is not a bailout and shareholders lose a lot, but she Swiss gov *would have* bought Credit Suisse had UBS refused. And my guess is they only bought it because as far as I understand $2 billion is a steal (and was probably forced by the Swiss governement so THEY don't have to use a bail out) and UBS can't lose on this deal.3 Seems so cheap for such a large, storied company.

"Google to cut down on employee laptops, services and staplers for ‘multi-year’ savings","In a rare companywide memo from CFO Ruth Porat, Google kicked off “multi-year” employee service cuts.

The company is cutting back on laptops and equipment, according to more detailed internal documents viewed by CNBC.

"First Republic Bank recovers 30% today, considers downsizing after being ""Saved""","[Full Article](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/first-republic-considers-downsizing-if-capital-raise-fails-sources-2023-03-21/)

First Republic Bank (FRC), the U.S. regional bank struggling to remain viable following a flight of deposits, is looking at ways it can downsize if its attempts to raise new capital fail, according to three people familiar with the matter.

First Republic has been working with JPMorgan to find new sources of capital after a consortium of major banks provided it with a total of $30 billion in deposits last week in a move of solidarity. Unrealized mark-to-market losses in First Republic's loan book and investment portfolio have been an obstacle to clinching an investment, Reuters has reported.

First Republic is examining how it can sell parts of its business, including some of its loan book, in a bid to raise cash and cut costs, one of the sources said. A sale of loans to other parties, including private equity firms, is one option under consideration, two of the sources said.

While a sale of the entire bank remains possible, First Republic is still currently focused on a capital raise, the third source said.

[FRC Stock Report](https://www.pluto.fi/stock/FRC)\- Sources cautioned the situation remained **fluid** and asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential.

Apple (AAPL) to Spend Billions More on Entertainment,"From [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/apple-to-spend-billions-more-on-entertainment-7370447)

""Apple Inc. (AAPL), the world's most valuable company, is mulling a billion-plus dollar foray into movie theaters and sports streaming in an attempt to drive subscriber growth for its Apple TV+ streaming platform.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Apple could spend more than $1 billion a year to ramp up its movie releases and sports streaming.

The company is reportedly in talks with film studios to partner on theatrical releases of movies by Martin Scorsese and Ridley Scott.

Previously, Apple has devoted most of its $6.5 billion film and TV budget to television programs.

The move could help to drive viewers to Apple's streaming platform, Apple TV+, which lags far behind competitors like Amazon and Netflix.

Apple is expected to spend $1 billion a year to produce movies for theatrical release. 

The company is reportedly in talks with movie studios to partner on the releases of upcoming movies by Martin Scorsese, Ridley Scott, and others.

The company is also reportedly considering bidding on the streaming rights to English football games.


The new plans constitute a significant increase in Apple's entertainment spending that could be part of an effort to draw more interest in Apple TV+, which lags behind rivals in subscriptions. Apple TV+ has an estimated 40 million subscribers, compared with at least 200 million each for Amazon's (AMZN) Prime Video and Netflix (NFLX).


Apple also lags behind rivals in content spending. The company spent about $6.5 billion on movies and television in 2021, while Amazon and Netflix spent $9 billion and $17 billion respectively.


So far, Apple's greatest streaming success has been in television, with the acclaimed series Ted Lasso. The business of releasing movies for wide theatrical distribution may be more complex, particularly given theater chains' struggles to rebound from COVID-19 and fend off competition from streaming services. Movie ticket sales are about a third below 2019 levels. Chains like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (AMC) have attributed the sluggish sales to a shortage of available films.

Apple's distribution agreements may help boost ticket sales, and it is not the only tech company entering theaters. Amazon acquired major studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for $8.5 billion last year and now plans to make up to 15 movies for theatrical release each year. 

In each case, Apple and Amazon may attempt to drive streaming viewership by later releasing those films on their respective platforms.

Apple's interest in adding English football games to its streaming platform follows last year's $2.5 billion 10-year streaming deal with U.S. Major League Soccer. Terms of a potential deal between Apple and the UK's Premier League have not been disclosed.""

Personally, this sounds like the kind of move that more streamers (looking at you, Netflix) need to make. They aren't going to be throwing ridiculous money at it, but the content they are looking to produce is starting to look more like HBO level quality. If they have acclaimed directors like Scorsese and Ridley Scott on board, they could get their films in with a big theatrical release, make a shit tonne of money, THEN bring it onto streaming (much like Paramount did with Top Gun Maverick) for a bigger subscriber gain. Sounds like a win win win to me and we all know Apple has $billions in pocket change to throw at this.",124jfdk,662,181,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/124jfdk/apple_aapl_to_spend_billions_more_on_entertainment/,"1 Apple, buy the rights to NBA games.

Apple is one of the few companies with the cash flow to build a streaming business from scratch.

So far, they've been doing a pretty excellent job at it.  Apple TV reminds me of how HBO used to be decades ago.  Very high quality content.  Not a lot of it, but what's there is high quality. 

Now if they can increase the QUANTITY of that high quality, things get interesting and it would be a differentiator from the ""spray and pray"" content at some others.4 This is pretty smart, if we are going into a recession then low cost entertainment options is a smart expansion. Folks will put off the expensive vacation, night out drinking/expensive events, high cost electronics and opt more frequently for the cheaper viewing experience at home where they can control costs like food and drinks.5 With Apple trying to diversify its main revenues from hardware sales (yes, people are upgrading less often), it only makes sense for them to invest in Services.",Apple
"Charles Schwab CEO says firm has liquidity, not seeking capital or deals","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charles-schwab-ceo-says-firm-235205914.html

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Charles Schwab has ample liquidity, the chief executive of the bank and brokerage said on Tuesday, moving to allay concerns about a ""doomsday scenario"" that has weighed broadly on bank stocks after the failure of two U.S. lenders since Friday.

""We have not raised capital and we are not in the market at this point for M&A transactions,"" Walt Bettinger, CEO of Charles Schwab, told Reuters in an interview.

The firm saw an influx of $4 billion in assets to the parent company on Friday as clients moved assets to Schwab from other firms, Bettinger said.

Schwab on Monday reported that total client assets slid to $7.38 trillion in February, down 4% compared with a year ago.

Bettinger said Schwab was comfortable with the assets on its bank portfolio -- which is separate from its brokerage business -- contrasting it with other companies that had run into trouble.

""Our available for-sale portfolio is short in duration and high in quality, and our held-to-maturity is slightly longer in duration but still short compared to many people, and very high-quality,"" said Bettinger, who has led Schwab since the 2008 financial crisis.

Banks can classify bonds as “held-to-maturity” (HTM) and are not required to count changes in value if the securities are kept until they are repaid, or they can keep the bonds as “available-for-sale” (AFS), which means they must count unrealized losses against capital, but are free to sell the securities at any time.

Compared to many regional banks that have come under pressure in the last week, Schwab has higher unrealized securities portfolio losses in comparison to its capital levels, said Richard Repetto, a managing director at Piper Sandler.

“That said, due to robust supplemental liquidity sources, we think it is very unlikely that SCHW will ever need to sell HTM securities to meet deposit withdrawal requests,” with $150 billion to $200 billion of available liquidity, he said in a note to clients on Monday.

The pressure on Schwab's stock eased after Bettinger told CNBC earlier on Tuesday that he had bought 50,000 Schwab shares while billionaire investor Ron Baron said he ""modestly increased"" his position in Schwab.

Schwab's shares closed up 9.2% at $56.68 on Tuesday, along with a broad rise in bank shares. Schwab shares, however, are down 25.6% from their close last Wednesday, the day before many bank shares began a downward spiral in reaction to problems at Silicon Valley Bank. SVB was shut down by regulators on Friday.

About 82% of deposits held by Schwab were insured, falling under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's limit of $250,000.

The bank has ""access to significant liquidity"" including an estimated $100 billion of cash flow from cash on hand, portfolio-related cash flows, plus new assets.





What do you all think about investing in larger banks like Schwab that aren't having liquidity issues?",11s5xdq,566,76,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/11s5xdq/charles_schwab_ceo_says_firm_has_liquidity_not/,"1 The part about 82% of the deposits being insured by the FDIC should provide any assurance you need.

Regulators seize Signature Bank in third-largest US Bank faulure,"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/regulators-seize-signature-bank-in-third-largest-us-bank-failure-231404695.html

Regulators seized New York regional bank Signature Bank (SBNY) two days after shutting down Silicon Valley Bank as overseers of the banking system try to restore calm before markets open Monday.

Signature becomes the third-largest bank to ever fail in the U.S., behind Silicon Valley Bank and Washington Mutual in 2008, if its assets haven't changed significantly since the end of 2022. Signature had $110 billion in assets as of Dec. 31, ranking 29th among U.S. banks. It had $88 billion in deposits as of that date.

A joint statement from the Treasury Department Secretary Janet Yellen, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and FDIC Chair Martin Gruenberg said that all deposit holders would be made whole, citing a ""systemic risk exemption"" that is also being applied to Silicon Valley Bank, but that shareholders and certain unsecured debtholders will not be protected. Senior management, they said, had been removed.

Any losses to the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund to support depositors who exceeded the $250,000-protected limit, they added, ""will be recovered by a special assessment on banks, as required by law."" The FDIC maintains the fund with regular contributions from banks.

Signature served clients in the cryptocurrency world. Like Silvergate Bank, another crypto-friendly bank that said last week it would voluntarily wind itself down, it had been suffering from an outflow in deposits in the aftermath of the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. The value of some of its securities had also dropped in value due to a rise in interest rates.

PSA: Investing and Trading Scam Reminder,"For those new to Reddit and to investing and trading - many people often complain that [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) mods are too draconian in removing posts and comments.

This is due to the number of investing scams and financial misinformation that is prevalent on social media platforms.

&#x200B;

1. Offers to DM should be viewed as suspicious. There is and continues to be a common method to recruit new investors to scams on both Reddit and Discord - do not assume that an offer to ""help"" is legitimate. 
2. It is common for bots and malicious actors on Discord to impersonate Reddit and Discord mods to distribute their scams. It is possible to create a Discord profile which appears similar to someone else. 
3. Pump and dump of stocks are common on social media - bots or stock promoters who are seeking to profit from pumping a stock or to create hype. You can sometimes identify if it's a bot or promoter simply by looking at the posters comment and post history. Often you will see that the account has posted nothing related to investing or trading but suddenly there is the same or varying versions of comments on one or two specific stocks. 
4. One other way to recognize suspicious posts is if the OP never engages in a discussion on comments and questions in the thread on their own dd. Those are all signs of stock promotion.
5. Offers to mirror trade and teach you how to trade are usually fake. If you receive private solicitations to open accounts at a broker or investment adviser, be wary.

If you are in the US - you can always verify the legitimacy of a broker or investment adviser.  You can check the registration status of a broker at the FINRA web site here - [https://brokercheck.finra.org/](https://brokercheck.finra.org/) You can check disclosures for investment advisers at the SEC IAPD web site here - [https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/](https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/)

UBS Nears Deal to Buy Credit Suisse for $1B,"No, it’s not a typo.

https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/19/business/ubs-credit-suisse.html

Full article:

The Swiss government is close to announcing a deal that would involve UBS buying Credit Suisse, its smaller, beleaguered rival, for about $1 billion, three people with knowledge of the matter said on Sunday.

The takeover of Credit Suisse is the most consequential fallout to date from the turmoil that spread from the implosion of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this month. But Credit Suisse’s troubles were largely of its own making, tied to years of scandals and financial missteps that have cost it billions of dollars in trading losses and legal fines.

Not even a $54 billion lifeline from the Swiss National Bank, announced last week, was able to stem the erosion of investor confidence that sank Credit Suisse’s shares to record lows. Talks between Credit Suisse and the far stronger UBS intensified over the past week, as Swiss banking authorities sought to avoid a chaotic dissolution of Credit Suisse.

Under the terms of the proposed deal, UBS will pay just a fraction of the roughly 8.8 billion Swiss francs, or $9.5 billion, that Credit Suisse was valued at on Friday, these people said. They cautioned that the terms are still being negotiated last minute and talks may still fall apart.

Representatives for Credit Suisse and the Swiss National Bank declined to comment, while those for UBS and Finma, the Swiss financial regulator, could not be immediately reached.

The Swiss government is expected to allow some financial rules to be bypassed, notably a six-week consultation period with UBS shareholders before any transaction can be approved.

The potential move represents the unwinding of a 166-year-old institution created to finance Switzerland’s rail network that ascended to the top echelons of finance, at times standing toe-to-toe with American titans like JPMorgan Chase. But Credit Suisse was tarred by scandals over the years — from money laundering to wrong-way trading bets — that left it reeling from losses and damaged its reputation.

The bank had been struggling to turn itself around in recent months, but two events last week contributed to Credit Suisse’s fall. First, the bank disclosed on Tuesday that there were “material weaknesses” in its financial reporting. And second, it was swept up in the broad and intensifying panic around the health of banks: As shares in lenders around the world tumbled following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, markets grew especially wary of Credit Suisse.

Prices for Credit Suisse shares and bonds dropped sharply all week, as did the cost of insuring its debt against default, despite efforts by Swiss regulators to shore up investor confidence. On Thursday, Credit Suisse said it would tap a $54 billion lifeline from the Swiss central bank in hopes of staving off a disaster.

Details of the proposed transaction with UBS were reported earlier by The Financial Times.",11vombe,138,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/11vombe/ubs_nears_deal_to_buy_credit_suisse_for_1b/,1 Can someone who’s smarter than me explain how this may affect the banks in the coming week?2 This isn’t a SVB related domino.

Furthermore, adoption will be slow. For one, it’s very hard to convince coats to trust a black box model over their own business acumen. Furthermore, industries that deal with privileged information will face significant legal challenges to any attempt they make at automating a process with AI.

But when it does come out full-force, the first thing that will be automated are jobs with repetitive decision-making. Customer service. Internal complaint resolution. Simple tech support. This is what AI is truly good at: making decisions based on historical patterns. That’s literally all it is. 

That being said - I’m avoiding computer tech right now for that reason. Companies have no idea what their actual capabilities are/aren’t. A company claiming that they are investing in AI initiatives means absolutely nothing until they can prove that their DE/DA built a solid backend for it and the managers know how to leverage it. I have a lot of my savings parked in real estate, renewable energy, consumable goods… Safe bets; things that will never go away. The AI landscape is cutthroat and constantly changing; any of those initiatives could fold tomorrow.3 I'm just going to ignore everything with AI.

And I guess a lot of companies with AI can get very overhyped/priced just because people like those two letters.

A lot of jobs will be obsolete in the future and AI does a pretty good job with writing code and coming up with text so the jobs I thought would disappear last can be the first ones to go.4 There are no answers better than MSFT/GOOG (and NVDA, TSMC, etc).

All the companies involved in the latest AI breakthroughs are private startups (OpenAI, Stability AI, etc). The other players involved are big tech company research labs (GOOG, MSFT, FB, etc), research at universities, and open-source projects (e.g. volunteers). The chips are only made by NVDA and TSMC, basically.

People looking for random companies to invest in (""looking for answers"") is how you get hype over companies that have no involvement in the latest AI breakthroughs, but use the right AI buzzwords and/or use older AI technology. In the past, IBM was an example of this with Watson.

After SIVB and SI fiasco.,After a wonderful weekend and lots of time for people to review and think about what happened last week to SIVB and SI. What does everyone think this coming week will bring especially with CPI due on Tuesday. A steep downfall in-stored? Or business as usual?  Personally I think a ripple effect will be coming and maybe some chaos. Thoughts and opinions would be appreciated.,11p1gjr,70,154,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/11p1gjr/after_sivb_and_si_fiasco/,"1 Good luck to everyone if inflation comes in hot. It’s going to cause chaos and a sell off imo. 

FWIW is always a good reminder at how useful “analysts” are.  Literally everyone of them had a buy rating on SVB with a $300+ price target even as of last week.


Analysts still move markets. Again, good luck if inflation is hot and they say exactly what everyone thinks - The Fed is a mess.


I’m not buying anything and only plan to add to long term holdings on significant pullback (TMO, DHR, HEI, COST etc)


Edit: Monday should be fun: https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11849049/Customers-line-outside-Republic-Bank-money-SVB-bank-collapsed.html?ito=native_share_article-nativemenubutton


Also, [Lest we forget](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_United_States) ( not insinuating this is the same but a good reminder of history)2 IF CPI undershoots it will be the biggest stroke of luck a government agency ever got. If it overshoots again we have 2 options:

1.	Keep raising rates and allow failures to happen when they occur, risking a spiral **down** out of control.
2.	Pivot and help the banks while also folding on inflation. This was the textbook in the 1970s and risks a spiral **up** out of control

So basically do they have the balls to keep going or are they going to show the world they really *dont* have what it takes to fight inflation.3 Who knows, no crystal ball.

My Guess: CPI hot still, Fed meeting the following week .5 rate hike (already priced in likely), no financial contagion from SIVB and SI other then in niche fields and specifically stocks of ultra growthy, future earnings based, small companies.  Market trend down but no fire sale, short term treasuries up yield, long term treasuries / agencies / muni's same yield but then will decrease yield with a delay.    just a guess.  I think the real blood bath, if there is one in stocks, will happen in june.  This also may not come to pass if by then inflation is downtrending faster and or the war ends which will add psychological support.4 I read an emphatic article about how SIVB ‘s collapse will NOT affect Wells Fargo. So I’m assuming WFC is about to go under.5 I don’t think anything has changed other than the drama being created in the media. Things are starting to break. This just means we are getting closer to the terminal rate and to true market bottom. This is what we expect to happen when the feds tighten. It just takes a while.",SIVB
FDIC announces agreement to sell Signature Bank assets to NYCB subsidiary,"\[This is about NYCB, not about SBNY\]

I own NYCB shares, recently bought at dip (Buy & hold) - for good dividend payer, but noticed today this one. Normally, this is good for bidder as they get a deal with takeover at deep discount. However, try to assess the current situation =>

""*Signature Bridge Bank, N.A., was created by the FDIC  on March 12, 2023, to take over the operations of Signature Bank, New York, New York, after the New York State Department of Financial Services closed the bank and appointed the FDIC as receiver.*

*As of December 31, 2022, the former Signature Bank had total deposits of $88.6 billion and total assets of $110.4 billion. Today's transaction included the purchase of about $38.4 billion of Signature Bridge Bank, N.A.'s assets, including loans of $12.9 billion purchased at a discount of $2.7 billion. Approximately $60 billion in loans will remain in the receivership for later disposition by the FDIC. In addition, the FDIC received equity appreciation rights in New York Community Bancorp, Inc., common stock with a potential value of up to $300 million.*

*The FDIC estimates the cost of the failure of Signature Bank to its Deposit Insurance Fund to be approximately $2.5 billion. The exact cost will be determined when the FDIC terminates the receivership.*""

Is this ever the case? It's not like only NYCB got this opportunity. These assets are auctioned off and the nature of auctions is they are won by whoever is the most willing to overpay. 

Bearish on all banks who acquire any of this crap. 

There's a reason Jamie Dimon said he would never participate in a similar deal again.3 Shareholders may need to sue the FDIC for the wrongful takeover of Signature since it wasn't insolvent, no proof of a full run on the bank, it has $110 billion in assets, $88 billion in deposits, in what world is that insolvent? The takeover destroyed the stock price. What Signature did wrong was getting involved with crypto currencies, that made the FDIC angry which hates anything with crypto.

The FDIC saw a perfect storm with Signature: a possible run- wasn't happening, negative sentiment from the stock market and Signature being a well know bank for the crypto sector- so it put the bank in receivership. It didn't restore confidence to the regional banks though, look at their stocks, it's like the hedge fund short sellers got the FDIC to help them. The FDIC did send a message though to other banks, if you're a publicly held corp- don't even think about being involved w/ crypto.",Signature Bank

If it survives five years there’s a chance at a very very nice return

Right now we don’t know if that will happen and the company could be gone in a few days or weeks.

If you need the money pull out what you can as soon as you can. If this was a gamble made with extra funds I’d let it play out at least till they release earnings next month.3 As a bag holder myself I'm gonna say it's not looking good.

If the right or wrong news comes out right now it could be over 50 or under 5 in an hour.4 Yes.

Possible catalysts are :
1) fed decides to cut now or in a few months 
2) fdic coverage made unlimited 
3) depositors come back in large amounts (synergistic with 2 and kind of 1)

If all three happen, it might even make it to 75 or 80 this year. 

Scenarios from best to worse for shareholders
1) mass deposits return, they actually eat Silicon Valley bank deposits in service, and fed rate cuts. Over 150 by EOY.
2) lots of deposits return in the next month by some method, and bank does a limited capital raise causing maybe 20% or less dilution. Maybe hits 70-80
3) some deposits return but they need a big capital raise anyway. Stock probably up from 15 but not a ton. 
4) not so many deposits return and stock needs a recap round at scale. Stock probably at 15 or less.  OR purchase at share price or below.

I think 2 or 3 are most likely because I think unlimited or effectively unlimited fdic happens.
 
My finance friends think FRB thinks they can hold on a bit and are rolling the dice on deposit return instead of take low ball offers.5 Tbh First Republic’s financial position is not bad at all. They have not experienced depreciation like SVB and are not exposed to similar industry risks. Now they have the Fed backing of assets as well.

Only problem is, pretty much nothing can save a bank if a bank run starts, not even the Fed asset buying program. Given that it hasn’t happened yet despite the stock price changes I believe that is a good sign but you never know. Even with SVB the bank would’ve probably survived had deposits not flown out so fast.

IMHO I personally would buy this stock while acknowledging the healthy dose of risk.",FRC

TD Bank & First Horizon Deal - Question about disclosure in Qtrly Statements,"Hello all,

In light of all the recent developments in the banking sector I wanted to see if someone here can help decipher some wording from the latest TD Bank (Ticker: TD) quaterly statements as it relates to a disclosure about their pending acuisition of First Horizon Corp (Ticker: FHN).

There is some wording around the mark-to-market of interest rate swaps that I can't quite get my head around and I'm hoping someone more familiar with the accounting and transactions of this type might be able to offer an opinion on just what is being captured.

The relevant section is from this document: [https://www.td.com/document/PDF/investor/2023/2023-Q1\_Earnings\_News\_Release\_F\_EN.pdf](https://www.td.com/document/PDF/investor/2023/2023-Q1_Earnings_News_Release_F_EN.pdf)

Page 5 has the relevant information under the heading ""Pending Acquisition of First Horizon Corporation"" it has this text (my emphasis):

""The fair value of First Horizon’s fixed rate financial assets and liabilities and certain intangible assets are sensitive to interest rate changes. The fair value of net assets will determine the amount of goodwill to be recognized on closing of the acquisition. Increases in goodwill and intangibles will negatively impact capital ratios because they are deducted from capital under OSFI Basel III rules. In order to mitigate this volatility to closing capital, the Bank de-designated certain interest rate swaps hedging fixed income investments in fair value hedge accounting relationships.

Since the de-designation, mark-to-market gains (losses) on these swaps are recognized in earnings, without any corresponding offset from the previously hedged investments. Such gains (losses) will mitigate the capital impact from changes in the amount of goodwill recognized on closing of the acquisition. The de- designation also triggered the amortization of the investments’ basis adjustment to net interest income over the remaining expected life of the investments.

**For the three months ended January 31, 2023, the Bank reported ($998) million in non-interest income related to the mark-to-market on the swaps, and $122 million in net interest income related to the basis adjustment amortization. In addition, for the three months ended January 31, 2023, the Bank reported $251 million in non-interest income related to the net interest earned on the swaps.**

Based on the estimated financial performance and balance sheets of the Bank and First Horizon, including transaction-related impacts, the Bank expects that its Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio will be comfortably above 11% upon the closing of the First Horizon acquisition.""

Q - So the question is, did they write down \~$1 Billion in the mark-to-market on the interest rate swap acquisition costs, is that correct?  And if so, does this suggest that they were holding a significant amount of long dated, low interest rate bonds and had to unload them at a substantial loss?  Just trying to understand exactly what this may be telling us.",11xsmet,20,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/11xsmet/td_bank_first_horizon_deal_question_about/,"1 I would have thought ""mark-to-market"" means they didn't actually sell them, just recognised that they would take a loss if they did.

then the meme stock phase came about and i sold quite a bit, but it invited a lot of people that disrupted the slow but steady discussion that was had. some people left and started their own private subreddits and it got all cliquey. it was very very weird. i don't consider myself an OG having joined in early 2020 so i never cared to migrate, just stayed subscribed. it's better nowadays but the subreddit is just a bit more difficult to stay on top of as a result.3 Ahhh good ol Mavis made me some money when meme stocks were flying….

Why Warren Buffett Bought More $OXY?,"Buffett has been buying Occidental Petroleum (OXY) stock. As of March 2023, Berkshire Hathaway owns 23% of OXY, making it the company's largest shareholder.

Occidental Petroleum Corporation is an American multinational petroleum and natural gas exploration and production company. Occidental's principal businesses consist of three segments: oil and gas, chemical, and marketing and midstream. 

OXY's stock has been on a tear in recent months, up more than 50% year-to-date. The company's stock is currently trading at around $65 per share, near its all-time high.

Here are some of the reasons why Warren Buffett may have been attracted to OXY:

Investment opportunity: Buffett is known for seeking out good investment opportunities. OXY may have appeared attractive to him due to its strong cash flow, diversified assets, and the potential for growth. OXY is a cyclical business. This means that the company's stock price is likely to go up and down with the price of oil. Buffett may believe that the price of oil is likely to go up in the future, which would boost OXY's stock price. OXY is a good fit for Berkshire Hathaway's investment strategy, they invests in companies that Buffett believes are well-run and have a strong competitive advantage. OXY fits this criteria, as it is a leading oil and gas company with a strong track record.

Favorable valuation: OXY stock may have been undervalued at the time of purchase, which would have made it a good investment opportunity for Buffett.

Attractive dividend yield: At the time of purchase, OXY had a high dividend yield, which would have been attractive to Buffett, who favors companies that pay steady dividends.

Bulls

1. There are a few reasons for OXY's stock surge. The company has benefited from the recent rebound in oil prices. Oil prices have been on the rise since the beginning of the year, and they are currently trading at around $110 per barrel. This has boosted OXY's earnings and cash flow.

2. OXY has been making progress in its debt reduction efforts. The company has reduced its debt by more than $10 billion since the beginning of the year. This has improved OXY's financial position and made it more attractive to investors.

3. OXY has been investing in new growth projects. The company is spending billions of dollars on new oil and gas projects in the Permian Basin and other areas. These projects are expected to boost OXY's production and earnings in the coming years.

Bears

1.  Debt: OXY has a significant amount of debt, which could be a risk if interest rates rise.

2.  Volatility: The energy industry can be highly volatile due to factors such as changes in global demand, geopolitical events, and fluctuations in commodity prices. OXY's stock price is sensitive to changes in oil prices. If oil prices decline, OXY's earnings and cash flow could be negatively impacted.

3.  Environmental concerns: The shift towards renewable energy sources and increasing regulations on emissions can negatively impact OXY's operations and profitability.

4.  Competition: OXY faces intense competition from other major players in the industry, which can affect its market share and pricing power.

Overall, OXY is a well-run company with a strong track record. The company is benefiting from the recent rebound in oil prices, and it is making progress in its debt reduction efforts. OXY is also investing in new growth projects that are expected to boost its production and earnings in the coming years.",12bmd47,7,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/12bmd47/why_warren_buffett_bought_more_oxy/,"1 Doesn’t he have preferred shares that guarantee 7% dividend?2 You forgot the most important thing - he loaned them $10B to acquire them and also has preferred stock.  The preferred stock will accrue dividends at 8 percent per annum, compared with about 5 percent yield on common equity and 4 percent on term debt.

You need to remember he views his investment as long-term and if you know - the dividends he gets from his Coke investment already exceeds his original investment - he is playing the long game.3 Because Buffet like money. Buffet think OXY make him money. So Buffet buy OXY.4 Oil is not trading at $110 bbl. It’s $80. I do see the upside with Oxy in many ways. I think BH is probably making a solid bet long term.5 OP... He also has warrants to by 89.3mil shares for $5bil.

My belief that what is going to happen is he's going to ultimately buy the company. You have to understand that when there is a takeover attempt to have to pay a premium to what the stock is currently trading at.

 Obviously, with the warrants that he has, he wants to keep the price he's paying per share under $60 and he has the ability to buy up to 50% of the company. Once Berkshire owns 50% of the company they will then tender an offer to buy the remaining 50%. This would keep his cost basis down because he won't have to pay a premium on the shares that he already owns, which would be half of the company.

So it's just a waiting game. Whenever the stock drops below $60 he buys more and will continue to do so until they own 50% and then tender an offer.",OXY
What does the EE stand for in EE bonds?,"I wonder what the letters ""EE"" represent in ""EE bonds"", i.e. whether it's an acronym and if so, what the full form of the EE acronym? I searched quite a bit and couldn't find the answer. I know what EE bonds are, but don't know why the two letters ""EE"" are used to designate these bonds.",11t7uur,6,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/11t7uur/what_does_the_ee_stand_for_in_ee_bonds/,"1 I don’t think EE is meant to stand for anything. Having read through the Wikipedia pages on historical US savings bonds, there were Series A, B, C, D, and E bonds. The [Series E bonds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_E_bond) were replaced by Series EE in 1980.

No indication they stand for anything and the alphabetical order suggests that is the only reason for their name.2 Savings bonds first got created during the Civil War.  The Spanish American war were a huge success.  By the 1930s the USA started issuing various series of direct to consumer bonds.  These bonds had different rules than one another and this was denoted by their Series.  Series A, Series B... In 1941 there was a series to help fund the massive military buildup the USA was engaging in called Series E. Series A-D had originally been pitched for poorer (middle class people) but they had ended up being bought up by richer ones.  Series E had rules designed to prevent that.  This set of rules worked.

The Series E was such a success that the government kept it running for a long time.  New Series were introduced, Series H being another big winner.  By 1972 as interest rates rose their were complaints about the Series E bonds program.   Eventually in 1978 the rules were revised and series EE and HH bonds were created to replace the popular E and H. 

1982 the rules had to be changed again.  At this point having two sets of rules made less sense.  The EE had proven more popular than the HH so the HH was retired.3 You need to understand the different types of bonds issued. E series is one of the few that is still active. I think EE started during the War. Every American showed they care for the country, adults and children all buy this Patroit in 1941 earning interest initially for 40 years then 30 years. Many Americans buy EE saving bond and retire on it. Stocks are fairly recent options because the commission charged was several $100 each trip.  Now it is free.

Dell stock research and valuation,"# Executive Summary:

Dell has stable long-term prospects. They are a mature company. If they can tame their balance sheet, they would likely significantly increase their share price through returns to shareholders.  Another possibility is that they try to become private again because Michael Dell only took the company public to finance an acquisition. They are currently trading at a significant margin of safety between 11% (no growth) and 44% (10% growth).

# Introduction:

Dell provides businesses with IT solutions, ranging from traditional infrastructure, cloud infrastructure, hardware, and software. They also provide consultant-like solutions such as management and migratory support. They also have consumer-oriented businesses that offer off the shelf and custom to order PC’s. About half of their revenue is generated in the Americas. They have made a number of large acquisitions, notably EMC (cloud infrastructure/solutions), SecureWorks (IT security), and Virtuestream(Cloud ops). They have operations in 180 countries.

The business is organized into two operating segments, Infrastructure Solutions Group, and Client Solutions Group.

|Group|Client Solutions Group|Infrastructure Solutions Group|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Common functions|Branded hardware, peripherals, third party software support/deployment/configuration, warranties, customer service, financing, build to order.|Cloud Support, Cloud Services(Cloud Ops), Digital transformation& related services, Multi Cloud integration, Cloud native workload solutions.|
|General Description|This includes their PC segment and legacy build to order hardware solutions. Through agreements, they also provide services related to third party software, mostly with integral software on their branded devices.|Offer cloud services, and support businesses adopting cloud services, retain them as customers after, provides reliable recurring revenue. Competes with AWS/Azure Enterprise services as well as infrastructure support providers, oriented towards large enterprise.|

# History:

Dell was founded by Michael Dell in 1984. They produce cell phones, computers, other hardware, and software, but used to do “build to order” enterprise infrastructure, which was especially popular in the internet bubble. Its two divisions are Dell client solutions group (CSG), and Dell infrastructure solutions group (EMC). Dell acquired EMC in 2015 for $67 billion, diversifying into the enterprise software and store industry. They bought Alienware in 2006. The company has traditionally been involved in the enterprise hardware business, specifically developing custom infrastructure. They have a focus on high performance PC’s and custom PC’s. If anything can be taken from their corporate history, it is that the company is not afraid to take dramatic actions to save its skin.

By the late 2000’s the company could not turn profits in the “make to order” business. They decided to shift towards off the shelf consumer and enterprise solutions. They were taken private in 2013 and went public again in 2018. VMWare was owned by EMC, and thus came under the control of Dell. Dell has decided to spin off VMWare, and there is a pending acquisition by Broadcom. The VMWare spinoff was completed in 2021. Michael Dell has been chairman since 1984, and apart from 2004-2007, has been CEO of the company. Kevin Rollins was CEO between 2004-2007, but Michael Dell decided to replace him after 5 quarters of disappointing results.

## Understanding Dell’s business segments:

Dell is organized into two segments. They are the Client Solutions Group and the Infrastructure Solutions Group.

ISG brought in $34 billion last year with $3.7 billion operating income. It accounts for 34% of their business. If we assume that this is mostly attributed to the EMC purchase, we can draw conclusions about the rational of the purchase by looking at current operating results. The return on investment is underwhelming but considering that Dell is in a mature stage of growth, it is positive that such a large investment will, at this rate, pay off in less than 20 years. At the current rate, it appears dell is looking at a long-term horizon of 18-20 years where EMC will have to prove its worth. It is hard to tell, but it is likely that Dell only went public for the second time to aid in the EMC acquisition.

|Year|Operating Income|ROI|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2020|$4.0B|6%|
|2021|$3.7B|5.5%|
|2022|$3.7B|5.5%|

ISG accounts for $14.7 billion of goodwill, a substantial amount obtained from the EMC purchase. In the MRQ, ISG brought in more operating income than CSG despite its significantly lower revenue, an attestation to the profitability Dell enjoys from the still lucrative enterprise solutions business.

They have been able to gradually increase revenue from servers and networking due to improvements in the configurations and technology available to customers.

In the server vendor industry, Dell is a significant player, second only to HPE in market share held by a single company. They have the largest market share in OEM storage systems. Dependence on cloud in the modern business drives growth in this segment. ISG capitalizes on hybrid cloud integrations, as well as public cloud support through hardware and software directly for CSP’s. This is a fast growing and profitable industry, and Dell’s positions as an infrastructure provider creates a barrier to exit for existing clients who integrate their infrastructure with Dell.

CSG brought in the majority of revenue at $61 billion, however it cannot attain the same level of profitability, netting $4.3 billion, still a substantial profit margin. They have $4.2 billion in goodwill. Dell ships the third most PC’s out of all vendors and has been able to keep their market share steady over the past decade. They are consistently able to raise prices in CSG, however they are subject to upstream price pressures, which would see margins significantly decrease in cool economic environments.

In CSG, there is significant competition among many market participants who are deeply entrenched in the industry. No single company has anything close to a majority. CSG is heavily exposed to international markets, especially Taiwan and China, however they have no supply chain exposure to Russia and Ukraine, and Russian/Ukrainian operations account for less than 1% of revenue.

# Segment industry comparison:

The industry average for PC vendors is an 18% average profit margin, well above the 7% Dell has in CSG, which is indicative of the price it pays for scale. They would have trouble improving this value to industry standards without relinquishing their 16.5% market share for a much smaller share, a clear indication of the competitiveness of this industry.

The industry average for cloud/cloud infrastructure providers is less than two percent. This number is slightly misleading, because seasoned providers like Dell, Azure, HPE, and Amazon are grouped together with Startup cloud companies. Among larger, more seasoned cloud infrastructure providers, average profit margins are closer to 14%. ISG’s profit margin is 11%.

# Financial performance:

The financial data only goes back to 2015, however we can look at the figures for Dell EMC from which the financial history for ISG can be inferred.

Dell EMC’s revenue only decreased 5.7% in 2009 but increased by 13.3% in 2010. Their revenue decreased 39% between 2000 and 2002. An implosion similar to the internet bubble would likely produce similar results over the short term, but this should be taken as a floor for shrinkage unless there is some five-sigma event that wreaks havoc in the industry. Profit decreased almost 60% in the same period. If the company has a shaky balance sheet, midterm decreases of 50% can threaten their existence. Given how the company has weathered previous economic downturns and depending on the widespread tech exposure to the economic trends, the company could see losses between 6%-40% in a recession but would not be threatened on the basis of their liquidity in CSG.

Revenue has been exceptional in the past two years. The revenue CAGR is about 12%. Net income was negative before 2019 but has been slightly positive since then.

The company has been teetering around zero equity. As of March second, 2023 (most recent financials), they had liabilities exceeding assets by about $3.03 billion, which is down from minus $1.5 billion the year before. They have a significant cash position of $8.6 billion. Their debt structure is very manageable and spread out over the next 20 years. They have an average of $1 billion a year due except for $4.5 billion due in 2026. 24% of their assets are goodwill, which is not unreasonable for the cash flow it can expect from enterprise clients in the future. If they can control their balance sheet, it would be viable for them to buy back shares. Michael Dell does not like relinquishing control of his company, so this may become reality in the future and he could take the company private.

The quarterly and annual results for 2022 indicate there are hard times to come. They averaged a 2.4% profit margin. Operating cash flows decreased over 60% YoY. Despite this, there has been solid growth in operating cash flows in the past decade due to favorable business conditions, and real growth in a mature client base. The operating cash flows will return when economic conditions ease. Capex has increased with opex, which is mostly attributable to the ISG segment maintenance and expansion.

# Valuation:

In projecting the FCF, we should have two sections, one for the next three years resembling the most recent downturn in financial results, and then for the remainder, returning to more normal financial conditions. We will go with a long-term growth rate equal to their growth in a zero rate environment (12.25%) minus the long term target rate of 2%, discounted by the company cost of capital (10%) plus a long term average risk free rate of 5%. Time horizon of 10 years. With this DCF, we arrive at an **intrinsic value of $38.89 billion**. They have a strong ability to generate cash, and do not have prohibitively high capex. Even with no growth, as long as they can hold their cash flows and keep interest and capex down, they would still be valued at $30 billion. However, there could be significant impairments on the company’s ability to generate cash and raise debt if they cannot get their balance sheet under control.",11pwcjh,4,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/11pwcjh/dell_stock_research_and_valuation/,1 I don’t have any Dell stock but do have Dell corporate bonds.2 Do you happen to know what the benchmark DSCR or Current ratios are in this industry?

"Shareholders Wiped Out by SIVB's Collapse are Large Indexers Like Vanguard, Blackrock & State Street But Smaller Buyside Firms, including Swedish Pension Fund, Saw Merit in Holding SIVB","We all know that SIVB's shareholders have been wiped out. Well, it happens that the biggest shareholders were indexers and ETF builders trying to match the S&P 500 Composite and other indexes:  Vanguard, Blackrock and State Street.  Together, they used to hold $1.5 billion of SIVB shares before the price drop.

However, there were some buyside entities that were left holding the bag.  The largest discretionary holders of SIVB were (1) Swedish pension fund Alecta Pensionsforsakring, Omsesidigt, (2) Artisan Partners Limited Partnership and (3) Geode Capital Management, LLC (Fidelity's spin-off).  Together, they held shares worth $600-$700 million before the wipe out.

Discretionary here meaning they actively decided to invest in SIVB based on its merit, not passively by virtue of its inclusion in the S&P 500.  So if these shareholders are wiped out, are they materially hurt as going concerns?  Strongly doubt Vanguard, State Street and Blackrock are as they are large entities.  But what about the Swedish pension fund and a few other ones -- remember here that they are not exactly coming out and crying foul yet since they would be derided as ""incompetent"" in deciding to invest in SIVB.  Presumably these buyside firms held SIVB as part of a diversified portfolio.  But stories usually come out later regarding the wipe-out, equivalent to an S&P 500 component going abruptly bankrupt -- which is very rare.

The point here is that some portfolio managers still saw value in SIVB.  They did not foresee 3 things which, in combination, caused SIVB's collapse: (1) the duration mismatch resulting in large unrealized losses; (2) the withdrawal of deposit amounts in favor of US Treasuries due to the Fed rapidly raising rates; and (3) the subsequent run on the bank exacerbated by the announcement of a failed secondary offering to meet cash needs.

The bank was also rated A1 (A-) by Moody's -- why weren't the ratings analysts on the ball with regard to the duration mismatch while the Fed was rapidly raising rates?  Only after the bank was taken over during the weekend did the ratings come down to Caa2 (CCC) and the issuer rating downgraded to C.  Always one step behind, these Moody's credit analysts.  Did they lose anything?  they only lost a fee-paying client, one among many.  Why aren't the rating agencies being held accountable this time, when it's their specific job to assess SIVB's balance sheet for emerging risks?",11qgfpw,3,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/11qgfpw/shareholders_wiped_out_by_sivbs_collapse_are/,"1 I’ve read this 4 times and I’m still not sure what is the main question you are trying to ask2 Takes risk.

That's like saying the US government is the one hurt by natural disasters within the 50 states of the union.

Vanguard, Blackrock, Fidelity, and SS are included in the losers when anything big goes belly up because they have ~~their tentacles in everything~~ exposure in everything. Look back at 2021? Evergrande in China was getting BTFO but the west was largely not exposed except the big 4 and most notably blackrock which had exposure to it. Gamestop? Some news articles noted how some of the big 4 had exposure to the shorters and thus they would lose billions, but other articles noted how they were also some of the largest shareholders of gamestop (either directly or on behalf of their customers in ETFs). 

Let's also not forget that they are asset manangers. Most of the their exposure is not directly themselves owning the stuff but they are holding on behalf of their investors. SIVB going to $0 doesn't mean BLK/VG/F/SS have all their shares go to $0. Most of those shares, swaps, options, warrants, or other exposure to SIVB is on behalf of their clients buying into VOO, SPY, IWM, SSO, UPRO, etcetc. Those shares go to 0 and get passed on to investors.4 Moodys and the like assess creditworthiness, not the fundamental business strategies of companies and their adjustments to market conditions.

""*What is the star rating?*

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, often called the star rating, is a purely quantitative, backward-looking measure of a fund’s past performance, measured from one to five stars. Star ratings are calculated at the end of every month. You can search for a fund to see its most recent star rating for free on Morningstar.com.

*How does the star rating work?*

The Morningstar Rating methodology rates **funds within the same Morningstar Category** based on an enhanced Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure. To receive a Morningstar Rating, a fund must have a record of more than three years. 

*How is the star rating used?*

The Morningstar Rating helps investors assess a fund’s track record relative to its peers. It’s intended for use as the first step in the fund evaluation process.""2 VTAPX is not an etf and it [not lost money over its lifetime](https://stockcharts.com/freecharts/perf.php?VTAPX&p=6).  
Hard to give a serious answer to this question but props to Omnuk for managing it.3 Fund rating is virtually useless. It says nothing of the quality of any other data point than the return against it's benchmark over that period of time. 

Most index funds will be 3-4 stars because they will likely be usually in the 2nd quartile of fund performance over the 1,3,5 and 10 year periods. They usually have higher rating the longer the time period.

2 years ago Morgan Stanley Dennis Lynch mutual funds were 5 stars. Took in tons of AUM as a result. They are 1 stars today. Totally useless in terms of fund evaluation. 

Also note that morningstar once said the funds always the quickest to have their ratings change are 5 star funds.4 Morningstar rates funds with others in the same sector. Comparing ""stars"" across sectors is meaningless.

Morningstar ratings are as useful as Yahoo 1y Target Estimates for stocks - which are  completely useless.

Struggling to understand TIPS and VTIP (Vanguard Short-Term TIPS),"This fund has paid attractive dividends over the past couple years, but I'm struggling to understand the variables. Hoping someone can constructively talk to me like I'm 12 years old and recognize my current level of illiteracy/semiliteracy. 

**Some basics I don't understand (anything helps):**

* Struggling to grasp what influences the current real interest rate, which \[I think\] is the basis for a TIPS coupon rate at time of issue. 
* The price of the VTIP fund has steadily dropped 10%+ since 2021, yet dividends have held strong or increased. The market value of their holdings is \~3% less than face value. And holdings all have remaining maturity of under 5 years.
* There are several TIPS index funds. Why bother assembling funds representative of all available TIPS? It seems like the nature of how current face value of existing TIPS is affected by current inflation is predetermined by their coupon rates and inflation at the issue date, which remain constant. So why seek out a wide range TIPS with all different rates? Am I missing something by looking at a TIPS fund different than a fund full of regular equities designed to minimize exposure to a couple holdings that unexpectedly tank? Struggling on phrasing here, but not asking what an index fund is supposed to do.
* Ultimately, what could be expected to happen to the fund if inflation falls back to 2 or 3% over the next couple years?

It is. Real interest rates are influenced by Fed policy, economic growth expectations, supply and demand for capital.  

>The price of the VTIP fund has steadily dropped 10%+ since 2021  

Because real rates rose. See [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/11tlnpo/daily_general_discussion_and_advice_thread_march/jcnpgof/) if you don't understand why bond prices fall when their yields rise.  

>dividends have held strong or increased.  

Inflation was high in the past few years.  

>And holdings all have remaining maturity of under 5 years.  

It is a short term TIPS fund.  

>It seems like the nature of how current face value of existing TIPS is affected by current inflation is predetermined by their coupon rates and inflation at the issue date, which remain constant.  

The face values of all TIPS is affected by each CPI release, not just the month they were issued. The coupon is determined at issue, but coupons do not get added to the face value.  

>So why seek out a wide range TIPS with all different rates?  

You are free to buy a single TIPS if that's what you want. People often build diversified long term portfolios with various securities and don't intend to liquidate at one particular date, so a fund that continually buys all the TIPS is a low effort way to get that exposure in your portfolio.  

>Ultimately, what could be expected to happen to the fund if inflation falls back to 2 or 3% over the next couple years?  

In the short term, the return depends more on what happens to real rates than on what happens to inflation. But real rates will likely be strongly affected indirectly by what happens to inflation - the Fed would be more inclined to back off rate hikes and be much more willing to cut rates if the economy also (continues to) show signs of slowing. That would raise TIPS prices.  
  
In the medium term, low inflation would mean lower nominal returns from TIPS.2 Bond funds are required to distribute all their net income.  For TIPS funds that means both interest income and inflation income.

Yes the price is down since last year, but during the same period VTAPX distributed about $1.60.  That’s roughly between 6-7% of the share price during the period.  That money left the fund and lowered the share price.

The fund price is down because the securities in the portfolio get priced and rising interest rates cause bond prices to fall.  If the fund was allowed to reinvest its distributions, the share price would look better.  Instead they give the shareholder the option to reinvest or not.",VTIP

Would bing be a good investment with its new AI?,I was thinking about the potential of ai and I found it interesting Bing uses GPT-4.

Do you believe that the current market has underestimated the benefits that this would bring to one of the biggest companies in the world (read: do you believe it hasn't already been largely priced in)?2 Sure, it could be.  Microsoft has gotten a little AI-love the past weeks but a 12% jump in the past month is just a sliver of what the eventual winners in the AI marketshare battle will get.

In terms of wanting to invest in AI, there are a lot of small companies with higher upsides but far greater risks.  With Microsoft you basically risk nothing.  It's a hugely profitable company without a nickel from AI.  But it's not going to triple from AI either.3 A search engine is the worst case use for GPTs, by definition it doesn't know anything and it will make stuff up. They're dumb as fuck chasing this fad, in my opinion of course.4 There’s so many companies that indirectly provide exposure to AI and automation. Uber, Amazon and Apple are three solid examples.

Google is a better investment to me. It’s a monster of a business. They have the top 2 search engines in Google/Youtube. No other comes close. They’re well positioned to truly deliver AI at a mass scale. 

Price is much more attractive than the overvalued Microsoft. Balance sheet looks great. Lots of cash on hand. If employee efficiency improves, sky is the limit.5 Yup it’s a good investment. Openai will only improve chatgpt, some of the previous comments don’t understand and quickly it’ll improve.

When a bond is bought it will pay a periodic coupon which corresponds to the interest rate. 

If you bought a 5 year bond 2 years ago with an interest rate of 2%, well you would now be holding a 3y bond with an interest rate of 2%. But since anyone can get a 3y with 4% like you said, nobody will buy your 2% bond, it will be priced as it it was the current market interest rate for 3y bonds. The difference between the 2% of the bond when it was bought and the 4% will be made up in the price of the bond. 

This etf essentially holds lots of bonds and therefore has this on a big scale. When you buy in its kind of like buying a bond today at 2y to expiry. 

Caveat of these bond funds is that it doesn't reach expiry but it is constantly buying and selling bonds to simulate the performance of holding a 2y bond indefinitely. It will pay the dividends of what a 2y bond pays now roughly and it will move in price like a 2y bond moves in price. If interest rates go up it will drop and vice versa.4 You might want to consider sgov for 0-3 month bonds",VGSH

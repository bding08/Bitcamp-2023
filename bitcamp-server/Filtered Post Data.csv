UBS agrees to buy Credit Sussie for over $2bln - 75% haircut from Friday’s Market Cap,"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crunch-time-credit-suisse-talks-033651935.html

UBS has agreed to buy Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse after increasing its offer to more than $2 billion, the Financial Times reported on Sunday, as authorities bid to stave off turmoil when the markets reopen.

Officials have been racing to rescue the 167-year-old bank, among the world's largest wealth managers, after a brutal week that saw the second- and third-largest U.S. bank failures in history. As one of 30 global banks seen as systemically important, any deal for Credit Suisse could ripple through global financial markets.

At least two major banks in Europe are examining scenarios of contagion possibly spreading in the region's banking sector and looking to the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank to step in with stronger signals of support, two senior executives with knowledge of the discussions told Reuters.

A person with knowledge of the talks earlier told Reuters that UBS sought $6 billion from the Swiss government as part of a possible purchase of its rival. The guarantees would cover the cost of winding down parts of Credit Suisse and potential litigation charges.

One source previously said the talks were encountering significant obstacles, and 10,000 jobs may have to be cut if the two banks combined. The Swiss Bank Employees Association on Sunday called for the immediate creation of a task force to deal with the risk to jobs.

Swiss broadcaster SRF and other media reported that the government would hold an ""important"" press conference later on Sunday. They did not give any more details.

But yeah, if governments have to guarantee all banks at all times to protect deposits, why whould you allow banks to make high risk moves and pay bonusses to shareholders and employees when they succeed, only to have taxpayers make up the difference when it all fails.

Ok technically Credit Suisse is not a bailout and shareholders lose a lot, but she Swiss gov *would have* bought Credit Suisse had UBS refused. And my guess is they only bought it because as far as I understand $2 billion is a steal (and was probably forced by the Swiss governement so THEY don't have to use a bail out) and UBS can't lose on this deal.3 Seems so cheap for such a large, storied company.

"Google to cut down on employee laptops, services and staplers for ‘multi-year’ savings","In a rare companywide memo from CFO Ruth Porat, Google kicked off “multi-year” employee service cuts.

The company is cutting back on laptops and equipment, according to more detailed internal documents viewed by CNBC.

"First Republic Bank recovers 30% today, considers downsizing after being ""Saved""","[Full Article](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/first-republic-considers-downsizing-if-capital-raise-fails-sources-2023-03-21/)

First Republic Bank (FRC), the U.S. regional bank struggling to remain viable following a flight of deposits, is looking at ways it can downsize if its attempts to raise new capital fail, according to three people familiar with the matter.

First Republic has been working with JPMorgan to find new sources of capital after a consortium of major banks provided it with a total of $30 billion in deposits last week in a move of solidarity. Unrealized mark-to-market losses in First Republic's loan book and investment portfolio have been an obstacle to clinching an investment, Reuters has reported.

First Republic is examining how it can sell parts of its business, including some of its loan book, in a bid to raise cash and cut costs, one of the sources said. A sale of loans to other parties, including private equity firms, is one option under consideration, two of the sources said.

While a sale of the entire bank remains possible, First Republic is still currently focused on a capital raise, the third source said.

[FRC Stock Report](https://www.pluto.fi/stock/FRC)\- Sources cautioned the situation remained **fluid** and asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential.

Apple (AAPL) to Spend Billions More on Entertainment,"From [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/apple-to-spend-billions-more-on-entertainment-7370447)

""Apple Inc. (AAPL), the world's most valuable company, is mulling a billion-plus dollar foray into movie theaters and sports streaming in an attempt to drive subscriber growth for its Apple TV+ streaming platform.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Apple could spend more than $1 billion a year to ramp up its movie releases and sports streaming.

The company is reportedly in talks with film studios to partner on theatrical releases of movies by Martin Scorsese and Ridley Scott.

Previously, Apple has devoted most of its $6.5 billion film and TV budget to television programs.

The move could help to drive viewers to Apple's streaming platform, Apple TV+, which lags far behind competitors like Amazon and Netflix.

Apple is expected to spend $1 billion a year to produce movies for theatrical release. 

The company is reportedly in talks with movie studios to partner on the releases of upcoming movies by Martin Scorsese, Ridley Scott, and others.

The company is also reportedly considering bidding on the streaming rights to English football games.


The new plans constitute a significant increase in Apple's entertainment spending that could be part of an effort to draw more interest in Apple TV+, which lags behind rivals in subscriptions. Apple TV+ has an estimated 40 million subscribers, compared with at least 200 million each for Amazon's (AMZN) Prime Video and Netflix (NFLX).


Apple also lags behind rivals in content spending. The company spent about $6.5 billion on movies and television in 2021, while Amazon and Netflix spent $9 billion and $17 billion respectively.


So far, Apple's greatest streaming success has been in television, with the acclaimed series Ted Lasso. The business of releasing movies for wide theatrical distribution may be more complex, particularly given theater chains' struggles to rebound from COVID-19 and fend off competition from streaming services. Movie ticket sales are about a third below 2019 levels. Chains like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (AMC) have attributed the sluggish sales to a shortage of available films.

Apple's distribution agreements may help boost ticket sales, and it is not the only tech company entering theaters. Amazon acquired major studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for $8.5 billion last year and now plans to make up to 15 movies for theatrical release each year. 

In each case, Apple and Amazon may attempt to drive streaming viewership by later releasing those films on their respective platforms.

Apple's interest in adding English football games to its streaming platform follows last year's $2.5 billion 10-year streaming deal with U.S. Major League Soccer. Terms of a potential deal between Apple and the UK's Premier League have not been disclosed.""

Personally, this sounds like the kind of move that more streamers (looking at you, Netflix) need to make. They aren't going to be throwing ridiculous money at it, but the content they are looking to produce is starting to look more like HBO level quality. If they have acclaimed directors like Scorsese and Ridley Scott on board, they could get their films in with a big theatrical release, make a shit tonne of money, THEN bring it onto streaming (much like Paramount did with Top Gun Maverick) for a bigger subscriber gain. Sounds like a win win win to me and we all know Apple has $billions in pocket change to throw at this.",124jfdk,667,181,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/124jfdk/apple_aapl_to_spend_billions_more_on_entertainment/,"1 Apple, buy the rights to NBA games.

Apple is one of the few companies with the cash flow to build a streaming business from scratch.

So far, they've been doing a pretty excellent job at it.  Apple TV reminds me of how HBO used to be decades ago.  Very high quality content.  Not a lot of it, but what's there is high quality. 

Now if they can increase the QUANTITY of that high quality, things get interesting and it would be a differentiator from the ""spray and pray"" content at some others.4 This is pretty smart, if we are going into a recession then low cost entertainment options is a smart expansion. Folks will put off the expensive vacation, night out drinking/expensive events, high cost electronics and opt more frequently for the cheaper viewing experience at home where they can control costs like food and drinks.5 With Apple trying to diversify its main revenues from hardware sales (yes, people are upgrading less often), it only makes sense for them to invest in Services.",Apple
"Charles Schwab CEO says firm has liquidity, not seeking capital or deals","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charles-schwab-ceo-says-firm-235205914.html

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Charles Schwab has ample liquidity, the chief executive of the bank and brokerage said on Tuesday, moving to allay concerns about a ""doomsday scenario"" that has weighed broadly on bank stocks after the failure of two U.S. lenders since Friday.

""We have not raised capital and we are not in the market at this point for M&A transactions,"" Walt Bettinger, CEO of Charles Schwab, told Reuters in an interview.

The firm saw an influx of $4 billion in assets to the parent company on Friday as clients moved assets to Schwab from other firms, Bettinger said.

Schwab on Monday reported that total client assets slid to $7.38 trillion in February, down 4% compared with a year ago.

Bettinger said Schwab was comfortable with the assets on its bank portfolio -- which is separate from its brokerage business -- contrasting it with other companies that had run into trouble.

""Our available for-sale portfolio is short in duration and high in quality, and our held-to-maturity is slightly longer in duration but still short compared to many people, and very high-quality,"" said Bettinger, who has led Schwab since the 2008 financial crisis.

Banks can classify bonds as “held-to-maturity” (HTM) and are not required to count changes in value if the securities are kept until they are repaid, or they can keep the bonds as “available-for-sale” (AFS), which means they must count unrealized losses against capital, but are free to sell the securities at any time.

Compared to many regional banks that have come under pressure in the last week, Schwab has higher unrealized securities portfolio losses in comparison to its capital levels, said Richard Repetto, a managing director at Piper Sandler.

“That said, due to robust supplemental liquidity sources, we think it is very unlikely that SCHW will ever need to sell HTM securities to meet deposit withdrawal requests,” with $150 billion to $200 billion of available liquidity, he said in a note to clients on Monday.

The pressure on Schwab's stock eased after Bettinger told CNBC earlier on Tuesday that he had bought 50,000 Schwab shares while billionaire investor Ron Baron said he ""modestly increased"" his position in Schwab.

Schwab's shares closed up 9.2% at $56.68 on Tuesday, along with a broad rise in bank shares. Schwab shares, however, are down 25.6% from their close last Wednesday, the day before many bank shares began a downward spiral in reaction to problems at Silicon Valley Bank. SVB was shut down by regulators on Friday.

About 82% of deposits held by Schwab were insured, falling under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's limit of $250,000.

The bank has ""access to significant liquidity"" including an estimated $100 billion of cash flow from cash on hand, portfolio-related cash flows, plus new assets.





What do you all think about investing in larger banks like Schwab that aren't having liquidity issues?",11s5xdq,564,76,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/11s5xdq/charles_schwab_ceo_says_firm_has_liquidity_not/,"1 The part about 82% of the deposits being insured by the FDIC should provide any assurance you need.

Regulators seize Signature Bank in third-largest US Bank faulure,"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/regulators-seize-signature-bank-in-third-largest-us-bank-failure-231404695.html

Regulators seized New York regional bank Signature Bank (SBNY) two days after shutting down Silicon Valley Bank as overseers of the banking system try to restore calm before markets open Monday.

Signature becomes the third-largest bank to ever fail in the U.S., behind Silicon Valley Bank and Washington Mutual in 2008, if its assets haven't changed significantly since the end of 2022. Signature had $110 billion in assets as of Dec. 31, ranking 29th among U.S. banks. It had $88 billion in deposits as of that date.

A joint statement from the Treasury Department Secretary Janet Yellen, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and FDIC Chair Martin Gruenberg said that all deposit holders would be made whole, citing a ""systemic risk exemption"" that is also being applied to Silicon Valley Bank, but that shareholders and certain unsecured debtholders will not be protected. Senior management, they said, had been removed.

Any losses to the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund to support depositors who exceeded the $250,000-protected limit, they added, ""will be recovered by a special assessment on banks, as required by law."" The FDIC maintains the fund with regular contributions from banks.

Signature served clients in the cryptocurrency world. Like Silvergate Bank, another crypto-friendly bank that said last week it would voluntarily wind itself down, it had been suffering from an outflow in deposits in the aftermath of the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. The value of some of its securities had also dropped in value due to a rise in interest rates.

PSA: Investing and Trading Scam Reminder,"For those new to Reddit and to investing and trading - many people often complain that [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) mods are too draconian in removing posts and comments.

This is due to the number of investing scams and financial misinformation that is prevalent on social media platforms.

&#x200B;

1. Offers to DM should be viewed as suspicious. There is and continues to be a common method to recruit new investors to scams on both Reddit and Discord - do not assume that an offer to ""help"" is legitimate. 
2. It is common for bots and malicious actors on Discord to impersonate Reddit and Discord mods to distribute their scams. It is possible to create a Discord profile which appears similar to someone else. 
3. Pump and dump of stocks are common on social media - bots or stock promoters who are seeking to profit from pumping a stock or to create hype. You can sometimes identify if it's a bot or promoter simply by looking at the posters comment and post history. Often you will see that the account has posted nothing related to investing or trading but suddenly there is the same or varying versions of comments on one or two specific stocks. 
4. One other way to recognize suspicious posts is if the OP never engages in a discussion on comments and questions in the thread on their own dd. Those are all signs of stock promotion.
5. Offers to mirror trade and teach you how to trade are usually fake. If you receive private solicitations to open accounts at a broker or investment adviser, be wary.

If you are in the US - you can always verify the legitimacy of a broker or investment adviser.  You can check the registration status of a broker at the FINRA web site here - [https://brokercheck.finra.org/](https://brokercheck.finra.org/) You can check disclosures for investment advisers at the SEC IAPD web site here - [https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/](https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/)

UBS Nears Deal to Buy Credit Suisse for $1B,"No, it’s not a typo.

https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/19/business/ubs-credit-suisse.html

Full article:

The Swiss government is close to announcing a deal that would involve UBS buying Credit Suisse, its smaller, beleaguered rival, for about $1 billion, three people with knowledge of the matter said on Sunday.

The takeover of Credit Suisse is the most consequential fallout to date from the turmoil that spread from the implosion of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this month. But Credit Suisse’s troubles were largely of its own making, tied to years of scandals and financial missteps that have cost it billions of dollars in trading losses and legal fines.

Not even a $54 billion lifeline from the Swiss National Bank, announced last week, was able to stem the erosion of investor confidence that sank Credit Suisse’s shares to record lows. Talks between Credit Suisse and the far stronger UBS intensified over the past week, as Swiss banking authorities sought to avoid a chaotic dissolution of Credit Suisse.

Under the terms of the proposed deal, UBS will pay just a fraction of the roughly 8.8 billion Swiss francs, or $9.5 billion, that Credit Suisse was valued at on Friday, these people said. They cautioned that the terms are still being negotiated last minute and talks may still fall apart.

Representatives for Credit Suisse and the Swiss National Bank declined to comment, while those for UBS and Finma, the Swiss financial regulator, could not be immediately reached.

The Swiss government is expected to allow some financial rules to be bypassed, notably a six-week consultation period with UBS shareholders before any transaction can be approved.

The potential move represents the unwinding of a 166-year-old institution created to finance Switzerland’s rail network that ascended to the top echelons of finance, at times standing toe-to-toe with American titans like JPMorgan Chase. But Credit Suisse was tarred by scandals over the years — from money laundering to wrong-way trading bets — that left it reeling from losses and damaged its reputation.

The bank had been struggling to turn itself around in recent months, but two events last week contributed to Credit Suisse’s fall. First, the bank disclosed on Tuesday that there were “material weaknesses” in its financial reporting. And second, it was swept up in the broad and intensifying panic around the health of banks: As shares in lenders around the world tumbled following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, markets grew especially wary of Credit Suisse.

Prices for Credit Suisse shares and bonds dropped sharply all week, as did the cost of insuring its debt against default, despite efforts by Swiss regulators to shore up investor confidence. On Thursday, Credit Suisse said it would tap a $54 billion lifeline from the Swiss central bank in hopes of staving off a disaster.

Details of the proposed transaction with UBS were reported earlier by The Financial Times.",11vombe,133,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/11vombe/ubs_nears_deal_to_buy_credit_suisse_for_1b/,1 Can someone who’s smarter than me explain how this may affect the banks in the coming week?2 This isn’t a SVB related domino.

Furthermore, adoption will be slow. For one, it’s very hard to convince coats to trust a black box model over their own business acumen. Furthermore, industries that deal with privileged information will face significant legal challenges to any attempt they make at automating a process with AI.

But when it does come out full-force, the first thing that will be automated are jobs with repetitive decision-making. Customer service. Internal complaint resolution. Simple tech support. This is what AI is truly good at: making decisions based on historical patterns. That’s literally all it is. 

That being said - I’m avoiding computer tech right now for that reason. Companies have no idea what their actual capabilities are/aren’t. A company claiming that they are investing in AI initiatives means absolutely nothing until they can prove that their DE/DA built a solid backend for it and the managers know how to leverage it. I have a lot of my savings parked in real estate, renewable energy, consumable goods… Safe bets; things that will never go away. The AI landscape is cutthroat and constantly changing; any of those initiatives could fold tomorrow.3 I'm just going to ignore everything with AI.

And I guess a lot of companies with AI can get very overhyped/priced just because people like those two letters.

A lot of jobs will be obsolete in the future and AI does a pretty good job with writing code and coming up with text so the jobs I thought would disappear last can be the first ones to go.4 There are no answers better than MSFT/GOOG (and NVDA, TSMC, etc).

All the companies involved in the latest AI breakthroughs are private startups (OpenAI, Stability AI, etc). The other players involved are big tech company research labs (GOOG, MSFT, FB, etc), research at universities, and open-source projects (e.g. volunteers). The chips are only made by NVDA and TSMC, basically.

People looking for random companies to invest in (""looking for answers"") is how you get hype over companies that have no involvement in the latest AI breakthroughs, but use the right AI buzzwords and/or use older AI technology. In the past, IBM was an example of this with Watson.

As an aside, someone else mentioned investing in Bay Area real estate which is pretty funny and might even work.5 all in nvidia calls 0 dte pt 9999999",AI
After SIVB and SI fiasco.,After a wonderful weekend and lots of time for people to review and think about what happened last week to SIVB and SI. What does everyone think this coming week will bring especially with CPI due on Tuesday. A steep downfall in-stored? Or business as usual?  Personally I think a ripple effect will be coming and maybe some chaos. Thoughts and opinions would be appreciated.,11p1gjr,71,154,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/11p1gjr/after_sivb_and_si_fiasco/,"1 Good luck to everyone if inflation comes in hot. It’s going to cause chaos and a sell off imo. 

FWIW is always a good reminder at how useful “analysts” are.  Literally everyone of them had a buy rating on SVB with a $300+ price target even as of last week.


Analysts still move markets. Again, good luck if inflation is hot and they say exactly what everyone thinks - The Fed is a mess.


I’m not buying anything and only plan to add to long term holdings on significant pullback (TMO, DHR, HEI, COST etc)


Edit: Monday should be fun: https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11849049/Customers-line-outside-Republic-Bank-money-SVB-bank-collapsed.html?ito=native_share_article-nativemenubutton


Also, [Lest we forget](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_United_States) ( not insinuating this is the same but a good reminder of history)2 IF CPI undershoots it will be the biggest stroke of luck a government agency ever got. If it overshoots again we have 2 options:

1.	Keep raising rates and allow failures to happen when they occur, risking a spiral **down** out of control.
2.	Pivot and help the banks while also folding on inflation. This was the textbook in the 1970s and risks a spiral **up** out of control

So basically do they have the balls to keep going or are they going to show the world they really *dont* have what it takes to fight inflation.3 Who knows, no crystal ball.

My Guess: CPI hot still, Fed meeting the following week .5 rate hike (already priced in likely), no financial contagion from SIVB and SI other then in niche fields and specifically stocks of ultra growthy, future earnings based, small companies.  Market trend down but no fire sale, short term treasuries up yield, long term treasuries / agencies / muni's same yield but then will decrease yield with a delay.    just a guess.  I think the real blood bath, if there is one in stocks, will happen in june.  This also may not come to pass if by then inflation is downtrending faster and or the war ends which will add psychological support.4 I read an emphatic article about how SIVB ‘s collapse will NOT affect Wells Fargo. So I’m assuming WFC is about to go under.5 I don’t think anything has changed other than the drama being created in the media. Things are starting to break. This just means we are getting closer to the terminal rate and to true market bottom. This is what we expect to happen when the feds tighten. It just takes a while.",SIVB
FDIC announces agreement to sell Signature Bank assets to NYCB subsidiary,"\[This is about NYCB, not about SBNY\]

I own NYCB shares, recently bought at dip (Buy & hold) - for good dividend payer, but noticed today this one. Normally, this is good for bidder as they get a deal with takeover at deep discount. However, try to assess the current situation =>

""*Signature Bridge Bank, N.A., was created by the FDIC  on March 12, 2023, to take over the operations of Signature Bank, New York, New York, after the New York State Department of Financial Services closed the bank and appointed the FDIC as receiver.*

*As of December 31, 2022, the former Signature Bank had total deposits of $88.6 billion and total assets of $110.4 billion. Today's transaction included the purchase of about $38.4 billion of Signature Bridge Bank, N.A.'s assets, including loans of $12.9 billion purchased at a discount of $2.7 billion. Approximately $60 billion in loans will remain in the receivership for later disposition by the FDIC. In addition, the FDIC received equity appreciation rights in New York Community Bancorp, Inc., common stock with a potential value of up to $300 million.*

*The FDIC estimates the cost of the failure of Signature Bank to its Deposit Insurance Fund to be approximately $2.5 billion. The exact cost will be determined when the FDIC terminates the receivership.*""

>Normally, this is good for bidder as they get a deal with takeover at deep discount.

Is this ever the case? It's not like only NYCB got this opportunity. These assets are auctioned off and the nature of auctions is they are won by whoever is the most willing to overpay. 

Bearish on all banks who acquire any of this crap. 

There's a reason Jamie Dimon said he would never participate in a similar deal again.3 Shareholders may need to sue the FDIC for the wrongful takeover of Signature since it wasn't insolvent, no proof of a full run on the bank, it has $110 billion in assets, $88 billion in deposits, in what world is that insolvent? The takeover destroyed the stock price. What Signature did wrong was getting involved with crypto currencies, that made the FDIC angry which hates anything with crypto.

The FDIC saw a perfect storm with Signature: a possible run- wasn't happening, negative sentiment from the stock market and Signature being a well know bank for the crypto sector- so it put the bank in receivership. It didn't restore confidence to the regional banks though, look at their stocks, it's like the hedge fund short sellers got the FDIC to help them. The FDIC did send a message though to other banks, if you're a publicly held corp- don't even think about being involved w/ crypto.",Signature Bank

If it survives five years there’s a chance at a very very nice return

Right now we don’t know if that will happen and the company could be gone in a few days or weeks.

If you need the money pull out what you can as soon as you can. If this was a gamble made with extra funds I’d let it play out at least till they release earnings next month.3 As a bag holder myself I'm gonna say it's not looking good. But hopefully you invested money you can live with going to nothing on this extremely risky bet. Hold till it booms or dies is my advice. No sense in cutting your losses with how volatile it is. If the right or wrong news comes out right now it could be over 50 or under 5 in an hour.4 Yes.

Possible catalysts are :
1) fed decides to cut now or in a few months 
2) fdic coverage made unlimited 
3) depositors come back in large amounts (synergistic with 2 and kind of 1)

If all three happen, it might even make it to 75 or 80 this year. 

Scenarios from best to worse for shareholders
1) mass deposits return, they actually eat Silicon Valley bank deposits in service, and fed rate cuts. Over 150 by EOY.
2) lots of deposits return in the next month by some method, and bank does a limited capital raise causing maybe 20% or less dilution. Maybe hits 70-80
3) some deposits return but they need a big capital raise anyway. Stock probably up from 15 but not a ton. 
4) not so many deposits return and stock needs a recap round at scale. Stock probably at 15 or less.  OR purchase at share price or below.

I think 2 or 3 are most likely because I think unlimited or effectively unlimited fdic happens.
 
My finance friends think FRB thinks they can hold on a bit and are rolling the dice on deposit return instead of take low ball offers.5 Tbh First Republic’s financial position is not bad at all. They have not experienced depreciation like SVB and are not exposed to similar industry risks. Now they have the Fed backing of assets as well.

Only problem is, pretty much nothing can save a bank if a bank run starts, not even the Fed asset buying program. Given that it hasn’t happened yet despite the stock price changes I believe that is a good sign but you never know. Even with SVB the bank would’ve probably survived had deposits not flown out so fast.

IMHO I personally would buy this stock while acknowledging the healthy dose of risk.",FRC

TD Bank & First Horizon Deal - Question about disclosure in Qtrly Statements,"Hello all,

In light of all the recent developments in the banking sector I wanted to see if someone here can help decipher some wording from the latest TD Bank (Ticker: TD) quaterly statements as it relates to a disclosure about their pending acuisition of First Horizon Corp (Ticker: FHN).

There is some wording around the mark-to-market of interest rate swaps that I can't quite get my head around and I'm hoping someone more familiar with the accounting and transactions of this type might be able to offer an opinion on just what is being captured.

The relevant section is from this document: [https://www.td.com/document/PDF/investor/2023/2023-Q1\_Earnings\_News\_Release\_F\_EN.pdf](https://www.td.com/document/PDF/investor/2023/2023-Q1_Earnings_News_Release_F_EN.pdf)

Page 5 has the relevant information under the heading ""Pending Acquisition of First Horizon Corporation"" it has this text (my emphasis):

""The fair value of First Horizon’s fixed rate financial assets and liabilities and certain intangible assets are sensitive to interest rate changes. The fair value of net assets will determine the amount of goodwill to be recognized on closing of the acquisition. Increases in goodwill and intangibles will negatively impact capital ratios because they are deducted from capital under OSFI Basel III rules. In order to mitigate this volatility to closing capital, the Bank de-designated certain interest rate swaps hedging fixed income investments in fair value hedge accounting relationships.

Since the de-designation, mark-to-market gains (losses) on these swaps are recognized in earnings, without any corresponding offset from the previously hedged investments. Such gains (losses) will mitigate the capital impact from changes in the amount of goodwill recognized on closing of the acquisition. The de- designation also triggered the amortization of the investments’ basis adjustment to net interest income over the remaining expected life of the investments.

**For the three months ended January 31, 2023, the Bank reported ($998) million in non-interest income related to the mark-to-market on the swaps, and $122 million in net interest income related to the basis adjustment amortization. In addition, for the three months ended January 31, 2023, the Bank reported $251 million in non-interest income related to the net interest earned on the swaps.**

Based on the estimated financial performance and balance sheets of the Bank and First Horizon, including transaction-related impacts, the Bank expects that its Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio will be comfortably above 11% upon the closing of the First Horizon acquisition.""

Q - So the question is, did they write down \~$1 Billion in the mark-to-market on the interest rate swap acquisition costs, is that correct?  And if so, does this suggest that they were holding a significant amount of long dated, low interest rate bonds and had to unload them at a substantial loss?  Just trying to understand exactly what this may be telling us.",11xsmet,19,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/11xsmet/td_bank_first_horizon_deal_question_about/,"1 I would have thought ""mark-to-market"" means they didn't actually sell them, just recognised that they would take a loss if they did.

then the meme stock phase came about and i sold quite a bit, but it invited a lot of people that disrupted the slow but steady discussion that was had. some people left and started their own private subreddits and it got all cliquey. it was very very weird. i don't consider myself an OG having joined in early 2020 so i never cared to migrate, just stayed subscribed. it's better nowadays but the subreddit is just a bit more difficult to stay on top of as a result.3 Ahhh good ol Mavis made me some money when meme stocks were flying….

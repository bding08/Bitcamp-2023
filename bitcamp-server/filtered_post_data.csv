UBS agrees to buy Credit Sussie for over $2bln - 75% haircut from Friday’s Market Cap,"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crunch-time-credit-suisse-talks-033651935.html

UBS has agreed to buy Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse after increasing its offer to more than $2 billion, the Financial Times reported on Sunday, as authorities bid to stave off turmoil when the markets reopen.

Officials have been racing to rescue the 167-year-old bank, among the world's largest wealth managers, after a brutal week that saw the second- and third-largest U.S. bank failures in history. As one of 30 global banks seen as systemically important, any deal for Credit Suisse could ripple through global financial markets.

At least two major banks in Europe are examining scenarios of contagion possibly spreading in the region's banking sector and looking to the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank to step in with stronger signals of support, two senior executives with knowledge of the discussions told Reuters.

A person with knowledge of the talks earlier told Reuters that UBS sought $6 billion from the Swiss government as part of a possible purchase of its rival. The guarantees would cover the cost of winding down parts of Credit Suisse and potential litigation charges.

One source previously said the talks were encountering significant obstacles, and 10,000 jobs may have to be cut if the two banks combined. The Swiss Bank Employees Association on Sunday called for the immediate creation of a task force to deal with the risk to jobs.

Swiss broadcaster SRF and other media reported that the government would hold an ""important"" press conference later on Sunday. They did not give any more details.

Credit Suisse shares lost a quarter of their value last week. The bank was forced to tap $54 billion in central bank funding as it tries to recover from scandals that have undermined the confidence of investors and clients.",11vr7km,1797,315,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/11vr7km/ubs_agrees_to_buy_credit_sussie_for_over_2bln_75/,"1 After hours it finished $2.16 so more like 80% cut2 Recent events really show that there is zero room for deregulation of banks and there is zero room for banks that hold customer deposits to take any real risks, because if they take risks and fail, customers will panic and withdraw, markets will panic and it will spread all over the world, causing banks to collapse like dominos only because of *temporary* liquidity issues due to insane amounts of withdrawals.

But yeah, if governments have to guarantee all banks at all times to protect deposits, why whould you allow banks to make high risk moves and pay bonusses to shareholders and employees when they succeed, only to have taxpayers make up the difference when it all fails.

Ok technically Credit Suisse is not a bailout and shareholders lose a lot, but she Swiss gov *would have* bought Credit Suisse had UBS refused. And my guess is they only bought it because as far as I understand $2 billion is a steal (and was probably forced by the Swiss governement so THEY don't have to use a bail out) and UBS can't lose on this deal.3 Seems so cheap for such a large, storied company. They must have really screwed the pooch again. This can't be a good sign for things to come.4 A huge blow to Switzerland and the Swiss banking system. Hopefully the contagion is off the table now.5 What will happen to cs shareholders? Are their shares worthless now?",UBS
"Google to cut down on employee laptops, services and staplers for ‘multi-year’ savings","In a rare companywide memo from CFO Ruth Porat, Google kicked off “multi-year” employee service cuts.

The company is cutting back on laptops and equipment, according to more detailed internal documents viewed by CNBC.

In separate documents viewed by CNBC, Google said it’s cutting back on fitness classes, staplers, tape and the frequency of laptop replacements for employees.

At the end of year our department would bring up a dumpster and fill it with boxes of brand new pens, clips, power adapters, mice, keyboards. Stuff that we had crammed in the cabinets all year because we need to use all of our budget for our department, or lose it.

Next year we'd fill all the cabinets again just in case we needed the stuff, and to keep the budget. What we didn't need went right in the dumpster again.

"First Republic Bank recovers 30% today, considers downsizing after being ""Saved""","[Full Article](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/first-republic-considers-downsizing-if-capital-raise-fails-sources-2023-03-21/)

First Republic Bank (FRC), the U.S. regional bank struggling to remain viable following a flight of deposits, is looking at ways it can downsize if its attempts to raise new capital fail, according to three people familiar with the matter.

First Republic has been working with JPMorgan to find new sources of capital after a consortium of major banks provided it with a total of $30 billion in deposits last week in a move of solidarity. Unrealized mark-to-market losses in First Republic's loan book and investment portfolio have been an obstacle to clinching an investment, Reuters has reported.

First Republic is examining how it can sell parts of its business, including some of its loan book, in a bid to raise cash and cut costs, one of the sources said. A sale of loans to other parties, including private equity firms, is one option under consideration, two of the sources said.

While a sale of the entire bank remains possible, First Republic is still currently focused on a capital raise, the third source said.

[FRC Stock Report](https://www.pluto.fi/stock/FRC)\- Sources cautioned the situation remained **fluid** and asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. The bank is still worth less than a fifth of where its shares were trading before the banking crisis started in the United States on March 8.

Apple (AAPL) to Spend Billions More on Entertainment,"From [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/apple-to-spend-billions-more-on-entertainment-7370447)

""Apple Inc. (AAPL), the world's most valuable company, is mulling a billion-plus dollar foray into movie theaters and sports streaming in an attempt to drive subscriber growth for its Apple TV+ streaming platform.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Apple could spend more than $1 billion a year to ramp up its movie releases and sports streaming.

The company is reportedly in talks with film studios to partner on theatrical releases of movies by Martin Scorsese and Ridley Scott.

Previously, Apple has devoted most of its $6.5 billion film and TV budget to television programs.

The move could help to drive viewers to Apple's streaming platform, Apple TV+, which lags far behind competitors like Amazon and Netflix.

Apple is expected to spend $1 billion a year to produce movies for theatrical release. 

The company is reportedly in talks with movie studios to partner on the releases of upcoming movies by Martin Scorsese, Ridley Scott, and others.

The company is also reportedly considering bidding on the streaming rights to English football games.


The new plans constitute a significant increase in Apple's entertainment spending that could be part of an effort to draw more interest in Apple TV+, which lags behind rivals in subscriptions. Apple TV+ has an estimated 40 million subscribers, compared with at least 200 million each for Amazon's (AMZN) Prime Video and Netflix (NFLX).


Apple also lags behind rivals in content spending. The company spent about $6.5 billion on movies and television in 2021, while Amazon and Netflix spent $9 billion and $17 billion respectively.


So far, Apple's greatest streaming success has been in television, with the acclaimed series Ted Lasso. The business of releasing movies for wide theatrical distribution may be more complex, particularly given theater chains' struggles to rebound from COVID-19 and fend off competition from streaming services. Movie ticket sales are about a third below 2019 levels. Chains like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (AMC) have attributed the sluggish sales to a shortage of available films.

Apple's distribution agreements may help boost ticket sales, and it is not the only tech company entering theaters. Amazon acquired major studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for $8.5 billion last year and now plans to make up to 15 movies for theatrical release each year. 

In each case, Apple and Amazon may attempt to drive streaming viewership by later releasing those films on their respective platforms.

Apple's interest in adding English football games to its streaming platform follows last year's $2.5 billion 10-year streaming deal with U.S. Major League Soccer. Terms of a potential deal between Apple and the UK's Premier League have not been disclosed.""

Personally, this sounds like the kind of move that more streamers (looking at you, Netflix) need to make. They aren't going to be throwing ridiculous money at it, but the content they are looking to produce is starting to look more like HBO level quality. If they have acclaimed directors like Scorsese and Ridley Scott on board, they could get their films in with a big theatrical release, make a shit tonne of money, THEN bring it onto streaming (much like Paramount did with Top Gun Maverick) for a bigger subscriber gain. Sounds like a win win win to me and we all know Apple has $billions in pocket change to throw at this.",124jfdk,663,181,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/124jfdk/apple_aapl_to_spend_billions_more_on_entertainment/,"1 Apple, buy the rights to NBA games. NBA league pass sucks and I pay a lot of money for it but there are a ton of ads and many more bugs.2 What a coincidence that Disney is firing 7k people.3 Strategically speaking, this is smart and ""chump change"".  Apple is one of the few companies with the cash flow to build a streaming business from scratch.

So far, they've been doing a pretty excellent job at it.  Apple TV reminds me of how HBO used to be decades ago.  Very high quality content.  Not a lot of it, but what's there is high quality. 

Now if they can increase the QUANTITY of that high quality, things get interesting and it would be a differentiator from the ""spray and pray"" content at some others.4 This is pretty smart, if we are going into a recession then low cost entertainment options is a smart expansion. Folks will put off the expensive vacation, night out drinking/expensive events, high cost electronics and opt more frequently for the cheaper viewing experience at home where they can control costs like food and drinks.5 With Apple trying to diversify its main revenues from hardware sales (yes, people are upgrading less often), it only makes sense for them to invest in Services.",Apple

UBS agrees to buy Credit Sussie for over $2bln - 75% haircut from Fridayâ€™s Market Cap,"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crunch-time-credit-suisse-talks-033651935.html

UBS has agreed to buy Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse after increasing its offer to more than $2 billion, the Financial Times reported on Sunday, as authorities bid to stave off turmoil when the markets reopen.

Officials have been racing to rescue the 167-year-old bank, among the world's largest wealth managers, after a brutal week that saw the second- and third-largest U.S. bank failures in history. As one of 30 global banks seen as systemically important, any deal for Credit Suisse could ripple through global financial markets.

At least two major banks in Europe are examining scenarios of contagion possibly spreading in the region's banking sector and looking to the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank to step in with stronger signals of support, two senior executives with knowledge of the discussions told Reuters.

A person with knowledge of the talks earlier told Reuters that UBS sought $6 billion from the Swiss government as part of a possible purchase of its rival. The guarantees would cover the cost of winding down parts of Credit Suisse and potential litigation charges.

One source previously said the talks were encountering significant obstacles, and 10,000 jobs may have to be cut if the two banks combined. The Swiss Bank Employees Association on Sunday called for the immediate creation of a task force to deal with the risk to jobs.

Swiss broadcaster SRF and other media reported that the government would hold an ""important"" press conference later on Sunday. They did not give any more details.

Credit Suisse shares lost a quarter of their value last week. The bank was forced to tap $54 billion in central bank funding as it tries to recover from scandals that have undermined the confidence of investors and clients.",11vr7km,1797,315,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/11vr7km/ubs_agrees_to_buy_credit_sussie_for_over_2bln_75/,"1 After hours it finished $2.16 so more like 80% cut2 Recent events really show that there is zero room for deregulation of banks and there is zero room for banks that hold customer deposits to take any real risks, because if they take risks and fail, customers will panic and withdraw, markets will panic and it will spread all over the world, causing banks to collapse like dominos only because of *temporary* liquidity issues due to insane amounts of withdrawals.

But yeah, if governments have to guarantee all banks at all times to protect deposits, why whould you allow banks to make high risk moves and pay bonusses to shareholders and employees when they succeed, only to have taxpayers make up the difference when it all fails.

Ok technically Credit Suisse is not a bailout and shareholders lose a lot, but she Swiss gov *would have* bought Credit Suisse had UBS refused. And my guess is they only bought it because as far as I understand $2 billion is a steal (and was probably forced by the Swiss governement so THEY don't have to use a bail out) and UBS can't lose on this deal.3 Seems so cheap for such a large, storied company. They must have really screwed the pooch again. This can't be a good sign for things to come.4 A huge blow to Switzerland and the Swiss banking system. Hopefully the contagion is off the table now.5 What will happen to cs shareholders? Are their shares worthless now?",UBS

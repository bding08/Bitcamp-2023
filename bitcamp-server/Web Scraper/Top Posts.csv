The company is cutting back on laptops and equipment, according to more detailed internal documents viewed by CNBC.

In separate documents viewed by CNBC, Google said it’s cutting back on fitness classes, staplers, tape and the frequency of laptop replacements for employees.

The Swinglines don't bind up as much.3 How many staplers do they own?4 I worked for a Fortune 50 company. They used to provide everyone with cell phones, then figured out everyone had their own cell phone anyways.

For a long time they paid for our high speed internet and routers, again stopped way later than when internet was common enough.

Laptop leases went from 2 years to 3, desktops from 3 years to 4.

At the end of year our department would bring up a dumpster and fill it with boxes of brand new pens, clips, power adapters, mice, keyboards. Stuff that we had crammed in the cabinets all year because we need to use all of our budget for our department, or lose it.

Next year we'd fill all the cabinets again just in case we needed the stuff, and to keep the budget. What we didn't need went right in the dumpster again.

*EDIT: The point being that cutting back on supplies doesn't mean the company is pulling a bunch of BS. Some cutbacks are simply common sense and should  have been done long ago.*5 Not the staplers"
1,OPEC+ cutting over 1.5M barrels per day in May.,"So what is the Fed going to do as inflation starts to climb dramatically driven by oil prices as banks continue to struggle (or collapse) under the weight of the hikes already completed. At this point a recession seems like the only path to bring inflation down to the 2% target and the only question is how deep of one.

Happy OPEC+ Cut Day to those that celebrate3 One way to screw the west lol4 Can we please just have a normal year. I need to get my sanity back.5 THe point of a cartel is to control production.  With everyone predicting a recession and lower oil usage, cutting production is the logical move. (also: US production is increasing over time, some of this is \*displacing\* OPEC production with US production. (The [reference case of the EIA](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/data/browser/#/?id=1-AEO2023&region=0-0&cases=ref2023&start=2021&end=2025&f=A&linechart=&ctype=linechart&sourcekey=0) predicts about a half a million bbs/day increase in US Production in 2023. (that was before oil prices went up after this announcement).    That roughly corresponds to the \*Russian\* 500K bbls/day decrease for the rest of the year thats part of OPEC+.  This is independent of SPR releases (which arent ""production"" but do become ""Exports"" in cases)"

3,Wasn't China supposed to utterly crash economically like 7 years ago? Is there an investment opportunity today?,"I remember constant articles about the Chinese government overextending themselves, about how they're building towns in the middle of nowhere that no one is moving to, about how a giant crash was due any day now. They've had ups and downs and followed the Covid trends, but overall, this day of reckoning never really came.

Do you think there are any good opportunities to be had by investing in Chinese companies or index funds? Or are there larger factors that will cause this fated decline?",12f5dzo,553,365,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/12f5dzo/wasnt_china_supposed_to_utterly_crash/,"1 China's been ""supposed to crash"" like a dozen times in recent history. Less than a year ago weren't we all freaking out about China's real estate sector collapsing and blowing up the global economy? Where'd that go?2 China is surely a big market with the ability to accommodate big capital inflows and a huge consumer market potential. We'd be lying if we said they aren't going to be huge. Just take the EV industry for e.g. EVs are going to make 80pc of all new car sales by 2028. from about 20pc now.. so yes, someone's going to make a lot of money. I'm just not sure who.. is it a Chinese company like Nio or Xpeng or are they gonna be fucked up by the CCP like they did Baba! Is it an american company like Tesla or are they gonna blackball the foreigners like they did Goog, Msft, Carrefour etc. 

Here are what I consider systemic risks in investing in China..
- Market distortions : Chinese market is heavily distorted by what are essentially state run enterprises.. they hold the most buying power in the Chinese system and are pretty much opaque. You don't know what's the next subsidization plan(upside risk) or regulation stick(downside risk) until the CCP just announces it one night. 
- Currency manipulation : Chinese are notorious for devaluing their currency when it suits them. Good luck trying to account for that. 
- Geopolitical uncertainity : no one knows how the CCP US relation evolves in the next 5-10 years except Xi. They could invade Taiwan. They could shoot down a Japanese plane or a Philippine ship and voilà we are at war.. Biden could sign another semis act like law and a whole sector my tumble overnight
- Debt overhang : Both Central and provincial governments have a lot of debt overhang, including sovereign and privately held debt. 300Bn USD on BRI. About a trillion and half of spent on vanity projects like high speed trains to nowhere. And the standard method of devaluation, cheap export and land resale won't work forever. This implies that if push comes to shove, their ability to stimulate a sector would be very limited.
I have many others : friend shoring(Apple moving to India; imminent demographic shock; cost of labour increase; lying flat movement; cost of living crisis causing reduced local consumption;.. any of them individually could kill a county's economy but together it's not a question of 'if' but of 'when'3 It depends on your definition of “crash”. Obviously if you assume maximalist scenarios, then it probably wont’t be what you expect.

They could fix the issues and grow, stagnate like Japan, or have a Mingplosion into warring states. No one knows the future - there are just some serious speed bumps now, and in the near- and long-term future.4 China is always crashing and never crashing. Schrodinger's lucky drunk driver.5 It's very much based on political risk but if relations are good with US and the CCP doesn't fuck over the industry you invest in then you can absolutely make a shit load.

For instance, the CCP banned tutoring at one point and all of the companies with that focus dropped by 90%+ to the point that they had significantly more cash than market cap in some instances like EDU, which has increased 8x since that point.

There are many such examples."
4,"Declines in Loan Values Are Widespread Among Banks, Lenders could face pressure on earnings or liquidity, or to pay higher rates for deposits.","From the wsj: https://www.wsj.com/articles/declines-in-loan-values-are-widespread-among-banks-c3ee622f?mod=hp_lead_pos2

>When Silicon Valley Bank collapsed last month, the core problem was a giant hole in its bond portfolio. When depositors started fleeing First Republic Bank pointing triangle soon afterward, the concern mainly was about a hole in its loan book.

>Nearly every publicly traded bank in the country is sitting on loans that have declined in value since they were made. The culprit is rising interest rates, which also slashed the value of banks’ other big asset, their holdings of securities. 

>The overall market-value losses on securities are well known because they are tallied up industrywide by banking regulators. The scale of market-value losses on loans made by publicly traded banks has to be tallied from banks’ securities filings.

>“Fair values of loans and securities are not qualitatively different,” said Tom Linsmeier, an accounting professor at the University of Wisconsin and former member of the Financial Accounting Standards Board. “They measure the same amount: the price at which the asset can be sold in an orderly transaction in the market today.”

>**First Republic’s balance sheet showed $166.1 billion of loans as of Dec. 31, at amortized cost. A footnote said their fair-market value was $143.9 billion. The $22.2 billion difference was greater than First Republic’s $17.4 billion of total equity, or assets minus liabilities.**

>The bank was seen by investors as risky because most of its loans at year-end were home mortgages with fixed or hybrid rates, meaning their low rates would stay fixed for one to 10 years. It also had $4.8 billion in unrealized losses on bonds. About 68% of its deposits were uninsured at year-end, meaning they exceeded Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. limits, which created greater flight risk. In that respect, it was similar to Silicon Valley Bank, which estimated that 88% of its deposits were uninsured. 

>First Republic bought itself time last month after a group of 11 banks led by JPMorgan Chase deposited $30 billion to halt the run. While the deposits helped liquidity, they didn’t boost First Republic’s capital. A First Republic spokesman declined to comment.

>While First Republic is an extreme example, it isn’t alone. Among 435 publicly traded U.S. banks listed on major exchanges, 97% of them reported that their loans’ market value was less than their balance-sheet amount as of Dec. 31, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.

>Combined, they had $242 billion of unrealized losses on their loans, defined as the difference between the loans’ fair values and carrying amounts. That was equivalent to 14% of their total equity and 21% of their tangible common equity, which is a widely used measure of net worth that excludes preferred stock and intangible assets.

>A year earlier, the same banks said their loans’ fair value exceeded their carrying amount by $96 billion, the data show. The same group showed $299 billion of unrealized losses on held-to-maturity securities as of Dec. 31. Those losses aren’t included on companies’ balance sheets.

>The unrealized losses on loans and securities likely fell at many banks in recent weeks as Treasury yields declined. The lower yields signal that investors think the economy is slowing. If they are right, then borrowers could start to fall behind on their loans, adding to losses on bank balance sheets.

>Banks reporting large fair-value discounts on their loans could face earnings or liquidity pressure. They could face pressure to pay higher rates for deposits and other funding sources, while yields on fixed-rate loans they own stay low. “If liquidity issues arise for these banks, they may need either to issue additional debt capital at higher interest rates or to sell those loans to become more liquid,” Mr. Linsmeier said.

>**The 435 banks in The Wall Street Journal’s sample included 100 where the combined unrealized losses on loans and held-to-maturity securities were equivalent to 50% or more of their total equity.**

>**Bank of Hawaii Corp. in its most recent annual report said it had $985 million of unrealized losses on loans and $799 million of unrealized losses on held-to-maturity securities, as of Dec. 31. The combined $1.8 billion total exceeded Bank of Hawaii’s $1.3 billion of total equity. The company estimated that 52% of its deposits were uninsured at year-end. A Bank of Hawaii spokeswoman declined to comment.**

>**Phoenix-based Western Alliance Bancorp. reported $3.9 billion and $177 million of unrealized losses on loans and held-to-maturity securities, respectively, as of Dec. 31. By comparison, the company had $5.4 billion of total equity. Western Alliance estimated that 55% of its deposits were uninsured at year-end.**

>**Western Alliance this week filed disclosures showing updated fair-value and deposit figures. Unrealized losses for loans and held-to-maturity securities had declined to $2.9 billion and $139 million, respectively, as of March 31. Deposits were $47.6 billion, down 11% since Dec. 31, while the uninsured-deposit ratio fell to 32%.**

>Dale Gibbons, Western Alliance’s chief financial officer, in an email said, “Western Alliance has access to significant liquidity from a variety of sources, including pledging loans to secure credit facilities, which mitigates need to sell assets and realize adverse asset marks.” He said the company doesn’t need to raise capital.

>**CVB Financial Corp., based in Ontario, Calif., reported $919 million and $399 million of unrealized losses on loans and held-to-maturity securities, respectively, as of Dec. 31. Combined, those were equivalent to 68% of its total equity, and they exceeded its tangible common equity. CVB estimated 65% of its deposits were uninsured at year-end.**

>CVB’s chief executive officer, David Brager, said the bank’s deposit relationships remain strong and often span decades. “We haven’t had significant relationships that have expressed concern,” he said. He noted the bank has grown slowly and doesn’t have any large industry concentrations comparable to Silicon Valley Bank’s tech-heavy focus.

>CVB’s chief financial officer, Allen Nicholson, said “most likely those unrealized losses have diminished somewhat” since year-end, because rates declined.

>Systemically important banks have an advantage over smaller banks, because they are widely perceived as too big to fail and implicitly backed by the government. Consequently, they may continue to attract low-cost deposits and retain uninsured deposits at the expense of smaller competitors, even if their disclosures show they have large capital holes on a fair-value basis.",12elgvc,522,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/12elgvc/declines_in_loan_values_are_widespread_among/,"1 ""Bond prices go down when interest rates rise""

This is absolutely shocking. I didn't realize banks lend money to people.2 Banks exist to borrow short and lend long.  Its been tough to be long duration the last years.  

That being said the last few weeks we've had a huge number of people who are worried about the effect of duration risk on stocks.  So they have been selling stocks and buying high quality bonds i.e. pure duration risk.  Which is a lot like jumping from the frying pan into the fire.  It also may be bailing many of those banks out as the panicking investors move the bank's balance sheet problems onto their own balance sheet.   Which IMHO would be wonderful justice regarding panic,3 Just surprised no one is mentioning the bank term funding program that allows banks to swap underwater paper, for a year, for par value. And it wasn’t widely used the first week, only around $12 b. Something like $53 b the second week. If all these banks are truly under water why aren’t there more swaps taking place?4 Can anyone help me understand the math to determine loss in loan value as a function of interest rate? For example, I closed on a refinance of a $120k 30 year mortgage at 3.25% in Jan 2022. How much is this debt worth at today’s rates? 

(Lol Jan 2022 closing was a total shitshow btw. The bank really tried to make me go away but I refused. The writing on the wall was clear to everyone at that point.)5 We need the dodd frank regulations on smaller banks so people have confidence in them, otherwise we will continue to see people flee small banks and it will continue to concentrate power and risk in mega banks."
